Help Me (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tigcal.helpme) is an emergency button application that allows you to send an SMS to your specified contact person with a click of a button. The message contains your last known GPS coordinates, as well as the nearest known place. The app will also continuously send SMS until you tap the "I am Safe" button.

If you have an Android Wear device, you can also use the wearable panic button application  to send emergency SMS.

*The first version of this app was created during the Accenture Technology Talks & Hackathon 2015.
