Help Me is an emergency button application that allows you to send an SMS to your specified contact person with a click of a button. The message contains your last known GPS coordinates as well as the nearest known-place. The app will also continually send SMS until you tap the "I am Safe" button.

If you have an Android Wear device, you can also use the wearable panic button application  to send emergency SMS.

*The first version of this app was created during the Accenture Hackathon and Tech Talks 2015.
